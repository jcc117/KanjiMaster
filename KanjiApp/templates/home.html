	<h5>Take a Quiz</h5>
	<p>
		Take a quiz based on your kanji proficiency. The grades are not necessarily in order of difficulty, but rather they are
		just different categories upon which can choose from. To practice a certain set of kanji, select that class. Each quiz is around
		30 questions. Each question is a multiple choice question asking you to match a kanji with it's romaji reading. You may take the
		quizzes as many times as you wish.
